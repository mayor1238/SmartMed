# Smart-Med NG – Project README

## Overview

Smart‑Med NG is a student health management dashboard built for the hackathon. The project focuses on allowing students to submit anonymous health symptoms, track wellness patterns, and help schools respond to common health issues.

The platform is deployed using **Vercel**, with the custom domain **smart-med.name.ng** purchased through **NiRA/WhoGoHost**.

## How the Project Was Created (Step-by-Step)

### 1. Designed the Dashboard in Figma

The UI was first designed using Figma to map out all dashboard screens including:

* Main dashboard
* Health report forms
* Student analytics
* Navigation and components

### 2. Built the Frontend

The UI was implemented exactly based on the Figma design using:

* HTML/CSS for structure and styling
* JavaScript to handle interactions and form behavior
* Responsive layout for mobile and desktop

### 3. Hosted the Project on Vercel

Steps:

1. Pushed project files to GitHub
2. Logged into Vercel and imported the repository
3. Vercel automatically deployed the site
4. The site was available at: `smart-med-ng.vercel.app`

### 4. Purchased a .ng Domain

* Bought **smart-med.name.ng** from NiRA via WhoGoHost
* Turned OFF the ID protection to reduce cost

### 5. Connected Domain to Vercel

1. Added the domain (smart-med.name.ng) inside Vercel dashboard
2. Vercel provided DNS records (A or CNAME)
3. Removed the default A record in WhoGoHost
4. Added the correct Vercel DNS values
5. Waited for DNS propagation (5–30 minutes)
6. Domain successfully linked to the Vercel site

## Deployment

After updating DNS, the project runs live at:
**[https://smart-med.name.ng](https://smart-med.name.ng)**

## Future Improvements

* Add backend to store real student health data
* Add admin dashboard login
* Improve health analytics
* Connect to school health APIs (optional)
